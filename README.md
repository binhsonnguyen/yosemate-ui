# Yosemite UI

Forked with love from @unity-ui by Mr. Steve Smith - orderedlist. I just want to make it more personal.

## Install

Clone package and use apm to install:

```
$git clone https://github.com/binhsonnguyen/yosemite-ui.git
$cd yosemite-ui/
$apm link .
```

If you want to update, browse to `packages` folder of your atom, and:

```
$cd yosemite-ui/
$git pull
```
